## **Background Context**
<a href=#cont>Back to Table of Contents</a>

* **Purpose:** The aim of this project is to analyze view the average prices and volume of avocado's sold per region in the USA.

* **Details:** Avocado has become one of the most popular foods worldwide. As the symbol of millennial health trends, this superfood is now a staple for food lovers everywhere. But have you noticed your avocado toast is getting more expensive? In recent years, avocado prices have surged by up to 129%, with the average price of a single Hass avocado hitting $2.10 in 2019, nearly doubling in just one year. So, what’s behind the rising cost of avocados?

> <b> Objective of the Project:</b> The aim of this project is to get a view of the average prices and volume of avocado's sold per region in the USA.

> <b> Data Source:</b> The data was downloaded from Kaggle and details the volume and average selling prices of avocados across the USA over 5 years(2015 - 2023). The data has been updated till December 3, 2023.Data provided here was collected from Hass Avocado Board - Category Data.

>**Note regarding the regions mentioned in dataset** "region" includes both regions and key locations which are cities or sub-regions. The values for locations do not add up to that of regions. The following are regions, as described here (another description of the dataset)
California,
West,
Plains,
South Central,
Southeast,
Midsouth,
Great Lakes,
Northeast.

>**About this file**
The product/price lookup code (PLU) uniquely identifies a product (mainly produce).

>HAB makes distinction between bags versus bulk. Bulk typically means avocados sold as individual pieces and are easily distinguishable with their PLU codes. Hence, the PLU refers to a bulk sale. On the other hand, the bags indicates a pre-packaged container consisting of a variable number of avocados of mixed PLU type. For instance, a package of six avocados may consist of 2 PLU 4046, 3 PLU 4770 and 1 PLU 4225. In other words, bagged sales are unable to account for individual PLU sales.

> <b> Importance of the Study:</b> Avocado has become one of the world’s trendiest foods. As the poster child of millennial healthy eating, this superfood is now a mainstay for foodies everywhere. But have you noticed your avo on toast is costing more and more? Avocado prices have rocketed in recent years by up to 129%, with the average national price of a single Hass avocado reaching $2.10 in 2019, almost doubling in just one year. So, why are avocados so expensive?

>Archaeologists in Peru have found domesticated avocado seeds buried with Incan mummies dating back to 750 BC. But it was the Aztecs in 500 BC who named it āhuacatl, which translates to “testicle.” When Spanish conquistadors swept through Mexico and Central America in the 16th century, they renamed it aguacate. The farming of aguacate developed over the next few hundred years, predominantly in Central America and South America. But consumption of the “alligator pear” outside of these regions before the late 19th century was almost nonexistent.

>The commercialization of aguacate began in the early 1900s but was focused on branding avocados as a delicacy for the wealthy, like this advert in The New Yorker from 1920, which declared them as “The aristocrat of salad fruit.” But a selection of Californian growers realized that the hard-to-pronounce aguacate was off-putting for the mass market, so they formed the California Avocado Association. By the 1950s, production scale grew, and avocado prices fell to about 25 cents each. Popularity increased further with the wave of inter-American immigration in the ’60s, as Latin Americans brought their love of avocados with them to the US. But as demand increased, supply had to keep up, and the true difficulties of yielding large-scale avocado crops began to show. Avocado orchards require an extraordinary amount of costly resources in order to flourish.(cited, https://www.limoneira.com/news-posts/avocado-prices-have-boomed-in-the-last-decade-heres-why-they-are-so-expensive/, 2 September 2024.

> <b> Key Questions or Hypotheses:</b> Null hypothesis , the Total Volume of avocados consumed is inversely proportional to the average price of avocados. Higher prices demands a lower volume.

> <b> Methodology Overview:</b> Follow EDA process

> <b> Structure of the Notebook:</b> The structure of the notebook imports the python libraries required to analyze the data , we then cleaned the data and performed exploratory data analysis.

> <b> Expected Outcomes:</b> I expect the volume of avocados consumed and the average price to increase year on year across the US.
